# This is a sample map to showcase the features of the mapping system.
#
# Here is a brief explanation of what the different commands do:
#
# !bpm - start by setting this value to the bpm of the music you're creating a
#        map for. This can be set multiple times in a map file and the hit
#        objects will take the value of the last specified bpm value.
#
# !zoom - this value is multiplied by the bpm to set how far apart hit objects
#         appear. For example, a bpm value of 60 and a zoom value of 1 means
#         every character will input a hit object every second. Change zoom to
#         4, and there's a hit object every quarter of a second, 8 every 1/8
#         second and so on.
#
#         When you change this value, any remaining beats in your stanza will be
#         filled out with blanks before the next stanza can begin. To override
#         this behavior, insert a !reset before !zoom. This sets the offset to
#         the previous hit object's position.
#
# !offset - this explicitly sets the offset value of the following hit objects.
#           This is particularly useful at the beginning of the song, as you are
#           able to perfectly align the first hit object with the start of the
#           beat.
#
# !reset - resets the hit object index and sets the offset to the position of
#          the previous hypothetical hit object. Might be useful for changing
#          zoom value between different beat patterns. Note: if you start adding
#          hit objects immediately on the following line and the last character
#          in the previous line represented a hit object, you will create two
#          hit objects with the same position, so use caution:
#
#          BAD:
#          !zoom 4
#          #   |   |   |
#          ddk ddk ddk d
#          !reset
#          !zoom 3
#          #  |  |  |  |
#          dk dk dk dk
#
#          GOOD:
#          !zoom 4
#          #   |   |   |
#          ddk ddk ddk -
#          !reset
#          !zoom 3
#          #  |  |  |  |
#          dk dk dk dk
#
# !scroll - this sets the approach speed of the following hit objects. By
#           default, hit objects move one pixel per millisecond, and this
#           value multiplies this - so "!scroll 2" means 2 pixels per
#           millisecond, "!scroll 0.5" one pixel every two milliseconds, and so
#           on.
#
# !group - defines the length per stanza; in other words, for every n * zoom hit
#          objects a cosmetic separator will be displayed on screen. This is
#          generally set according to the beat of the song, but if not declared,
#          separators will not be added. Setting this to 0 disables it
#          explicitly.
#
# !separator - inserts a separator at the given position. This is only meant to
#              be used with timestamp-based maps, so when mapping normally there
#              shouldn't be any reason to use this.
#
# Every character, except for the newline, corresponds to one beat unit. Any
# input character that isn't reserved inserts empty space between the hit
# objects.
#
# Any line beginning with a # is treated as a comment and will not be parsed.
#
# Lines beginning with an ! are commands, and this character should only be used
# for that purpose. Any extranous characters after a command are ignored.
#
# Here is a list of the different hit objects:
#
#  * d - normal inner drum hit
#  * k - normal rim hit
#  * D - large inner drum hit
#  * K - large rim hit
#  * O/o - drum roll, length specified through chaining, like "Oooooooo"
#
# To make it more clear how to set the proper variables according to the beat,
# it could make sense to use actual musical terminology.
#
# Consider standard musical notation. The length of a bar and the length of
# individual notes is usually set using a time signature like 3/4. The otfm
# format takes some liberties to better reflect the technical implementation
# instead of representing a musical score. To users familiar with the latter,
# it might seem a bit confusing at first.
#
# If we look at the most basic example - both zoom and group values of 1 - we
# can imagine that we have a 1/1 time signature. One character input means one
# whole note (ùÖù), and we have 1 notes per stanza.
#
# But when we expand to 4/4, the analogy breaks down because the "score" as it
# is displayed in a text editor does not deal with notes of different lengths,
# as the note length is dictated by the zoom value.
#
# It could make sense to imagine that the lower numeral, the zoom value, instead
# indicates the only type of note available, in this case the quarter note (‚ô©).
# If it was 2, then it would've been a half note (ùÖû). 3 would mean
# (approximately) a dotted quarter note (‚ô©.), and so on.
#
# Now, the group value would then represent how many whole notes (ùÖù) are in a
# "stanza", in this case, 4.
#
# It is worth noting that "stanzas" are only cosmetic and purely dictate when
# the separators are displayed on screen, they do not affect the mapping in any
# other way. Whether or not it makes sense to bring music analogy into this is
# entirely up to the user.

# Below you see a series of vertical bars, preceded by a comment mark (#) as
# used in this very comment. It is good practice to have some visual aid to help
# discern the beat. In this example, we simply have the bars reflect the zoom
# value (4): Bar two three four, bar two three four...

# It is good practice to end lines with a visible character at the end if the
# last character is not a hit object, otherwise it might not be so obvious in
# case one forgot to end a line with the proper spacing. An otherwise good way
# to test if your lines are aligned properly is to move to the previous line
# and pressing END followed by DELETE. It should be easy to see if the patterns
# are misaligned.
